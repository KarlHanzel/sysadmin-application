Ideal candidates will have experience configuring and managing a range of services in the Linux & Unix environment, including e-mail, storage, databases, and the web. They will also possess (and be unafraid to use) some programming skills well-suited to sysadmin tasks.

You must be able to write a useful shell script, and basic proficiency in [additional language of your choice] will do wonders for our assessment of your capabilities. 

Please use this directory to submit relevant samples of your code. For example:

* Things from some /etc that suggest we'd want to give you root access
* Shell utilities, services, clever one-liners
* Whatever else you think would create a reasonable impression of your skills

If you contribute to any open source projects, we'd love to know about them. This would be a good place to provide links with a description of your role in the project (so that we don't have to sift through commit history to find your contributions).
