Ideal candidates will have experience configuring and managing a range of
services in the Linux & Unix environment, including e-mail, storage, databases,
and the web. They will also possess (and be unafraid to use) some programming
skills well-suited to sysadmin tasks.

You must be able to write a useful shell script, and basic proficiency in
[additional language of your choice] will do wonders for our assessment of your
capabilities. 

Please use this directory to submit relevant samples of your code. For example:

  - things from some /etc that suggest we'd want to give you root access
  - shell utilities, services, clever one-liners
  - whatever else you think would create a reasonable impression of your
    skills

If you contribute to any open source projects, we'd love to know about them.
